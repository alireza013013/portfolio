# Front-End Developer Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my work as a front-end developer. It's built using modern web technologies like React, Three.js, and GSAP to provide a smooth and interactive experience.

## Features
- **React**: The project is fully developed with React, providing a fast and scalable web application.
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber**: For rendering 3D models and scenes, I've used Three.js integrated with React via React Three Fiber.
- **GSAP**: The animations across the site are powered by GSAP, making the transitions and interactions smooth and engaging.
